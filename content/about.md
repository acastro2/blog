## About the author

I'm a Principal Engineer at Enova International, developing and leading a software engineering team in several web-engineered products using AWS services.

I love what I do, from extracting business requirements, designing the architecture and infrastructure, ensuring code quality, maintainability, performance, tests, and coverage. Concurrently, striving for great teamwork with high collaboration and engagement while establishing agile development to ship good quality code fast.

I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and I have Brazilian and European Citizenship.
