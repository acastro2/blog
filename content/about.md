Hey there! My name is Alexandre, but you can call me Alex. I'm a software engineer with a passion for technology and a desire to always learn something new 🤓. I come from São Paulo, Brazil and currently living in Chicago, Illinois (brrr, it's cold here! ❄️)

I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and a Master's in Financial Engineering, which has helped me bring a unique perspective to my work 🧑‍🎓. With over eight years of experience in the tech industry, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects and hold leadership roles in multiple teams 💻.

Currently, I work as a Principal Platform Software Engineer at Enova International, where I get to play with cutting-edge technology and lead teams 🚀. I specialize in Golang, Software Architecture and Design, and Cloud Computing ☁️. I have experience working with AWS, Kubernetes and Terraform, and I'm always eager to learn more 🤩.

I believe that sharing knowledge is key to personal and professional growth 🧠, that's why I decided to start this blog. I want to connect with others who share my interests and learn from them too 🤝. So, feel free to reach out to me, I'll be more than happy to chat! Thanks for visiting! 👋
